I’m not a coder. I’m hardly an engineer.
I was an Excel jockey, forced to turn into a query monkey, writing SQL day in and day out — and then shoved into a Data Analyst role where I had to learn Python just to put data into neat little structures called dataframes. They made my job easier… and also more hectic.

I feel comfortable inside Python notebooks and had barely used Git in what now feels like a previous life (but was just my previous job). And here I am — trying to write Markdown files using different apps. Right now, I’m typing this in VS Code, relying on the obscure magic of Git and GitHub to power a blog managed by Jekyll.

Why?
Because I want to learn.
And because I’m a cheap bastard, and this was the least costly option.

This post is just a test to see if I can create a working blog workflow using VS Code.
