title: Getting used to markdown VS Code and git
---

I am not a coder, I am hardly an engineer. I was an Excel jockey who was forced to turn into a query monkey who would write SQL queries day in and day out and then shoved into a Data Analyst role where I learnt to use python to put data into neat looking structures called dataframes which made my job easier but hectic. I feel comfortable residing inside Python Notebooks and have barely used git in what feels like my previous life but was just my previous job. So here I am, trying to make markdown files using different apps, currently I am typing this in VS Code and then using the obscure magic of git and github to make my own Blog managed with Jekyll because I want to use this opportunity to learn, and because I am a cheap bastard and this was the least costly option. This post is just a test post to see if I can create a workflow using VS Code.
