title: It's rude to be polite in an AI world!
subtitle: Why you need to work hard even with an AI
---

### Article Summary
- Years ago, it was considered important to be polite, and the use of overtly formal phrases in communication was appreciated.
- Specialists like scribes would draft formal messages.
- We live in a world where all of us carry a scribe in our pocket.
- There is one slight problem: they are way too polite.
- This is because they are trained to be encouraging to drive engagement.
- In an ironic twist, we may need to employ methods to make our replies mildly rude so they feel authentic.

# Introduction

If you happen to get your hands on old letters written by common folks to each other, you'll notice something curious — overly formal language and prose that seem to be straight out of a Charles Dickens novel. Flowery vocabulary, elaborate pleasantries — this, when they are written to close friends, family, or even siblings (one would almost be mistaken to think that siblings didn't want to kill each other back in the day). This is, of course, in stark contrast to the "K, cya" you get from a generation that prefers hieroglyphics to communicate over meaningful phrases. To imagine that for centuries, the art of being civil in communication was honed by professionals and seasoned specialists — scribes — who are now merely an app in your pocket. Soon, we may as well have an AI reply "K, cya" for us. Unfortunately, if you're not careful, your recipient may end up getting a nice and polite "Thanks for checking on me. I will see you soon" from an AI assistant, belying the fact that you didn't even take the effort to type a few syllables and left it to a robot to do it on your behalf. How rude!

# Artificial Politeness

Humans have been interacting with bots for years now, and in the process of training them, we have created an entity that is extremely deferential and servile. This is [already creating problems of one kind](https://www.popsci.com/technology/openai-jerks/), but it is to be expected. After all, a model that blurts out truth bombs is hardly passing the systems of a human tester who, I imagine, would not take it kindly to a bot that calls them an unrequired, overpaid regulatory moron. Also, despite [Sam Altman suggesting](https://www.techinasia.com/news/being-polite-to-ai-thatll-cost-you-millions-altman-says) that we not be polite to AI, it is going to take a lot more [to stop us from treating it like a human](https://www.diplomacy.edu/blog/politeness-in-2025-why-are-we-so-kind-to-ai/). Besides, it's a good thing that the chatbot is polite in its tone — what harm could come of that, you may ask.

# Representing the Authentic You

In the recently concluded Google I/O event, Sundar Pichai demonstrated how, when a friend asked him for advice, [Gemini parsed through his past emails and drafted a reply for him](https://blog.google/technology/ai/io-2025-keynote/#personalization). Reading that mail in the demo, I couldn't help but feel a sense of [Uncanny Valley](https://bluemonarchgroup.com/blog/the-uncanny-valley-of-communication-when-it-sounds-right-but-feels-wrong/). The mail, while trying to be as authentic as possible, still sounded like someone taking way more effort to be helpful than a normal human being — let alone the CEO of Google. Also, by relating this incident, he has made it clear to the world that instead of taking the effort to reply to his friend, he would rather push a button and let it be some AI agent's problem. I can definitely imagine Felix, who received the mail, leaving the event with a sour taste after seeing that. Now imagine a new world where AI agents take care of the emails nobody bothers to write on their own. How wonderful would it be to get written communication that feels like it was crafted by a human being?

Unfortunately, it takes a lot of effort to write, and replying to people on emails is an arduous task most of the time. Fortunately, with a bit of hard work, we can definitely have an AI “me” that sends replies on our behalf and manages to be just irreverent enough to represent the authentic you. LLMs are, by definition, pattern-generating devices, so their output is going to depend a lot on the training set provided to them. Theoretically, an LLM could parse through all your mail and create a voice that sounds like yours — and this is probably what Gemini did in our cited example. In theory, it sounds like a perfect solution. The problem is that we may be writing emails to a lot of people with varying familiarity and tone. There's a simple fix: we can ask AI to set the tone as friendly, but when you do that, the model is likely to be overly polite. This may not be a problem now, but if all your mails start sounding too similar, the recipient will start to realise that they are talking to a bot. A simple way to avoid it is to instruct the model to add a few lines which add a personal touch in each mail. _"...Also add a line asking about their recovery from the injury they had talked to me about"_ — a simple instruction added to the mail is just enough to show that you took care in drafting the reply and, in general, is a good practice to improve your network and maintain friendships. Even better, if you share enough camaraderie with the person (only then), you can probably ask it to start the mail with a joke. _"Draft a reply with a joke about how they plan at the last minute"_ can probably work — even better if you supply a witty remark yourself and then ask AI to draft the rest of the mail.

# Conclusion

Let's face it: it's inevitable that soon we will be getting more communication written by bots. Perhaps it's happening already, and you may have noticed how every brand communication sounds kinda similar. While brands have the money and talent to make sure their bots get better, some of them are already figuring out [how to sound human while using AI](https://www.appnova.com/how-to-stay-authentic-in-an-ai-driven-world-a-guide-for-brands/). Meanwhile, while you may be tempted to save time with AI, you stand the risk of losing your individuality and warmth — the very things that authentic communication helps build. So before you decide to save time using an AI to send a quick reply, maybe spend some time to teach it a voice that represents a more genuine you. A touch of humor, a casual quip, a mild irritation — these are things that make us human, and it will be a challenging yet rewarding exercise to build them into your AI.
