After 700 days of procrastination, with some encouragement from ChatGPT, Archish looked at his github page and said "Let there be Blog" and... no blog appeared...so he sat down and created this blog on 26th day of what some humans call the month of May in the 2025th year after some dude appeared on Earth.
