## What is AGI?

We are living in the middle of an AI boom and there are talks about AGI and the race is on between the various tech giants to produce one. So what exactly is an AGI? 

Unless you are a confirmed Luddite, chances are you have already started using LLMs in your daily tasks. You may not be even aware of it, but LLMs have invaded your life already if you have clicked on any of the helpful suggestions that Gmail prompts you when you don’t want to reply. Right now, AI is a tool  well positioned to complete specific tasks. You can train a model to create text that feels like it’s been written by a human, create images, and, very soon, create a full length movie, but all of these require prompts to be provided by a human user. Now imagine an AI agent that is essentially human. An AGI will have the capability to learn; the learning becomes part of its memory, and instead of needing a prompt, the agent is capable of using its knowledge to finish useful tasks. In short, imagine an artificial being that learns like a human, performs like a human, but is not limited to the lifespan of a human.  

## What will an AGI worker look like?

Let’s take a human profession, say an accountant. Now think of all the time and effort that went into making such an accountant. An average human being needs 15–18 years of schooling and advanced education. They are not trained to be accountants from the start; they learn on varied topics. Post their education, they are inducted in a workplace and spend another 4-5 years to get through the ropes. Slowly they develop an acumen and tackle real life problems. In another 5-10 years, they reach their final form where they start taking decisions, solve business problems, and mentor the next generation of workers. 

Imagine a being that can start delivering those but with just a few years of training and keep giving you results beyond your lifetime. If you’re like me, you probably have already started feeling a bit nervous, and, chances are, there are already arguments that would have formed in your mind on why this is a bad idea. “How will we be sure that they will take the best decisions without being a human?”. “Maybe it can take rational decisions, but accounting is not all logic. How will it manage the human element?” These are questions that have already become part of popular discourse. I do wonder, have we faced anything like this in the past? 

Let’s face it, if an artificial construct is capable of being near human but provides more benefits, then they will eventually replace humans. The question therefore becomes, what is that line where we treat them as humans, and when we do that, what are the implications? This, I feel, creates the perfect ground for some interesting thought experiments. My objective here is not to argue for or against AGI; I just want to portray an imaginary world where AGIs replace workers at each level and have fun playing out the various scenarios. As far as I know, right now only humans can do this more creatively than any tool available to us right now. So here we go.

### 1. AGI replaces interns and freshers

Once a year we get the comfort of wide eyed humans who would gladly bring us coffee and do some menial tasks. As the AI tools started replacing them, the workplace turned a bit dry. The new interns are not keen to go beyond their core duties  to create a good impression and increase their chances of getting hired. You get a being that is focused on one task alone - to learn and execute. It takes notes intently and produces detailed minutes of meetings. It converts them into reports, and it feels like having a chess grandmaster as your personal secretary. It may occasionally cross your mind whether it’s too good for its tasks, but the senior people are still needed to take decisions. Besides it’s only taking over menial tasks. 

### 2. AGI replaces managers

As more and more AGI replaces the lower rung, it becomes clear that it is just not humanely possible to manage a group of such advanced intelligence. Sure, they do the menial tasks but they just do it too fast. How can you justify paying for a bunch of them that can work without rest but are constrained by the time sheet of their overseer? Soon, economical pressure introduces an AGI which augments a middle manager. Let’s be clear, they can’t fully replace the human because we still need a human being to take responsibility for decisions and outcomes.So we end up getting two managers : a human and an AGI, which takes over when the human is not around. This can be a bit messy though. What kind of ship is run by two captains, after all? Eventually, we reach a crucial juncture:  either the management is entirely humans or completely AI, not both. Since humans are likely to take this decision, we know which way they lean…

### 3. AGI replaces CXOs

People are messy. They take economically irresponsible decisions, and emotions can lead to errors. There are definitely fields where decisions are taken under extreme pressure, and we need a calm and composed head taking them. Once again, we see the limitations of human beings acting as constraints. 

However, the ethical dilemma of AGI taking decisions can no longer be ignored. An AI can make logically right decisions, sure, but can it make an empathic one? So the senior management now transitions into a controlling body role. The AI acts as the chief executive, but its decisions are to be argued and debated by a senior board, so we ultimately have humans taking responsibility. However, this reintroduces the problem of speed. What is the point of having a super intelligent being that can be trusted to make optimal decisions fast only to be slowed by a board. Maybe, the solution is to have an ethical bot that can optimally select only the relevant decisions for human beings and leave the mundane decisions to the AGI. 

Humans have few core functions in such an organization: 
1. Create a broad vision and mission that provide the direction for the executive bots. 
2. To deliberate over the decisions that are presented by the AGI.

### Utopia and dystopia
Imagine a world where there is no divide between the rich and the poor. A world where all the economical activities are carried out by robots and the humans can live their lives in leisure. An equal society where the humans are relegated to a role of debating and arguing over complex ethical dilemmas and social progress while the robots take care of the rest. Almost all our futuristic dreams come true. The best AI minds solve our energy problems, they discover ways to travel through space, mining bots that carry out the dangerous task of bringing resources from nearby planets. 

However, is a world bereft of all hardship really desirable? Often the best experience of working hard on a skill is to labor intensely. There’s a joy in doing repetitive and boring work and building that skill-muscle. ["It could be important to make things difficult in an AI age."](https://every.to/thesis/in-the-ai-age-making-things-difficult-is-deliberate).A world where we outsource it to other beings was imagined in the Pixar movie Wall-E and it was not utopian by any measure.
